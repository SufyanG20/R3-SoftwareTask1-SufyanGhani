My project was a 7 segement dsplay controlled by a potentiometer to display the digits from 0 to 99. I was unable to finish the full task, but got most of it done. The wiring was complete for all components, however I was unable to code both the displays together to display all the numbers. Currently my project is only using one display which displays the digits from 0 to 9. I tried to code both the displays, but was running into bugs and errors in the code, so I scrapped it and just stuck to one of the displays.
